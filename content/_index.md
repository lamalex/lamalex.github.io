I am a master's of computer science student at ODU.
I study _big data, and distributed systems_.
I am a vegetarian and I like to 🚲 &nbsp; 🏃🏻‍♂️ and 🏋🏻‍♂️.
I have three 🐕: <span class="doglist">
    <a href="#" class="image-rollover" data-filename="nacho.png">Nacho</a>, 
    <a href="#" class="image-rollover" data-filename="safia.png">Safia</a>, and 
    <a href="#" class="image-rollover" data-filename="izzard.png">Izzard.</a>
</span>
**Black lives matter**. Reparations are necessary.

My current research is using behavioral economics and mobile
health technologies to help people lift weights safer.

I teach advanced submarine navigation for the US Navy, but I am actively looking for systems work!
