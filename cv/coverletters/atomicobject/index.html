    <p>I'm a jack-of-all-trades polyglot engineer who loves taking on new challenges. In my career I've built high-quality software in Python,
Java, JavaScript, Rust, Swift, and with many more tools &amp; languages. I love finding the right tool for the right job and leveraging it to build reliable, fun-to-use systems. I spent seven years riding around the world on U.S. Submarines, and if I had to summarize what contributed most to our continued success it would be <strong>team ownership</strong>. On a submarine everyone would die a horrible death if there were a &quot;that's not my job&quot; attitude. I'm thankful to be at decreased risk for death at sea, but the core values I learned as a submariner make me a better software engineer. I like to work on projects where the team <em>gives a shit</em>, and where values like craftsmanship, empathy, and grit are pillars of success. In other words, Atomic Object.</p>

    <p>On my team at Ford Credit I'm always working to make things better. Some of my major successes include reducing our pull-request build time by 15%, creating processes around tracking tech debt, and reducing the response time of a critical API from 4 seconds to under 1 second. These weren't work items that were handed down from project management, but pain points I identified and organized a plan to make better. I love recognizing the amazing accomplishments of my teammates, and feel real pride when my colleagues do great work. I've been on my team for 6 months, but my manager told me that she, &quot;can't remember when I wasn't on the team.&quot; I hope in 6 months my colleagues at Atomic Object are saying the same thing.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider me as your next Atom;</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to our next conversation.</p>
