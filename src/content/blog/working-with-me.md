## My Leadership Philosophy
I believe in fostering an environment where engineers can grow and thrive while delivering high-quality technical solutions. My approach centers on:

- **Technical Excellence**: Leveraging deep technical expertise to guide and mentor while empowering ownership
- **Operational Efficiency**: Continuously seeking ways to simplify systems and reduce complexity
- **Full-Stack Awareness**: Encouraging engineers to develop broad technical capabilities across the stack
- **Innovation with Purpose**: Driving meaningful technical changes that improve team efficiency and system reliability
- **Team Growth**: Actively looking for opportunities to challenge and develop team members through strategic project assignment
- **Experimental Mindset**: Creating systems and processes that make it easy and safe to try new approaches

Success in these areas comes through a deep commitment to ownership at all levels and a culture that embraces thoughtful experimentation. I believe in building teams where every member feels empowered to innovate and responsible for our collective success.

### Ownership
I believe deeply in ownership as a foundational principle. This means:

- **No "That's Not My Job"**: This phrase is antithetical to our success. We succeed and fail as a team.
- **Domain Expertise IS Your Job**: You have the right (and responsibility) to become an expert in your domains.
- **Cross-Functional Understanding**: While specialization is valuable, understanding how your work impacts others is crucial.
- **Problem-Solving Without Borders**: If you see a problem, you're empowered to solve it, regardless of "whose area" it's in.
- **Team Success Over Role Definitions**: Job descriptions are starting points, not boundaries.

This philosophy manifests in how I:
- Encourage engineers to develop "full-stack awareness"
- Support cross-training and skill development
- Recognize and reward initiative beyond role boundaries
- Structure projects to build broad expertise
- Evaluate and reward team members

### What This Means For You
- You'll be encouraged to expand your expertise beyond your current comfort zone
- I'll support your growth into new areas that interest you
- You'll be recognized for taking initiative and solving problems holistically
- I expect you to think about system-wide impacts, not just your immediate task
- When you see something that could be better, you own making it better

## Communication Style & Preferences
- I am known for being direct, concise, and efficient in my communication
- My Slack messages are often brief and to the point
- While this brevity comes from a place of efficiency, I acknowledge it can sometimes be perceived as abrupt or harsh
  - *I'm actively working on this*, please give me feedback
- I deeply respect everyone I work with, regardless of their role or experience level
- I welcome direct feedback

## How Best to Work with Me
### Communication
- Don't hesitate to ask for clarification if my responses seem too brief
- I appreciate direct, straightforward communication
- Feel free to schedule time with me for longer discussions
- I prefer Slack to e-mail. I try to conduct **work** conversations in public channels. 
  If you have a question, want to have a discussion on a task, or have something for the team
  I'll encourage you to start a thread in one of our channels. My DMs are always open as well,
  and personal conversations can (and will!) be had there.

### Feedback
- I actively seek and welcome feedback on all aspects of my work and leadership
- No feedback is too small - I want to hear it all
- I prefer receiving feedback either via 15five, or through Slack
- I promise to receive all feedback with openness and appreciation

### Decision Making
- I value data-driven decisions and technical rigor
- I encourage healthy debate and discussion
  - I have a tendancy to bikeshed. I honestly love this stuff. 
    You're an owner; if you think a technical discussion is veering off the rails you have the power to get it back on track

## Influential References & Principles

### Technical Philosophy
- **"Parse, Don't Validate"** (Alexis King): Shapes my approach to system design and data handling. I believe in designing systems that make invalid states unrepresentable and handling data transformations explicitly at boundaries. This influences how I review code and architect solutions.

### Work & Time Management
- **"Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"** (Paul Graham): I try to balance maker and manager time, both for myself and the team. I protect large blocks of focused time for deep technical work and try to cluster meetings to preserve flow states. Please be mindful that context switching has a high cost, especially during technical deep-dives.
